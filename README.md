ReactiveLocation library for Android
====================================

Small library that wraps Google Play Services API in brilliant [RxJava](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava)
```Observables``` reducing boilerplate to minimum.

**This library is still in its early beta.**

What can you do with that?
--------------------------

* obtain last known location
* subscribe for location updates
* manage geofences
* geocode location to list of addresses

How does the API look like?
----------------------------

Simple. All you need is to create ```ReactiveLocationProvider``` using your context.
All observables are already there. Examples are worth more than 1000 words:


### Getting last known location

    ReactiveLocationProvider locationProvider = new ReactiveLocationProvider(context);
    locationProvider.getLastKnownLocation()
        .subscribe(new Action1<Location>() {
            @Override
            public void call(Location location) {
                doSthImportantWithObtainedLocation(location);
            }
        });

Yep, Java 8 is not there yet (and on Android it will take a while) but there is
absolutely no Google Play Services LocationClient callbacks hell and there is no
clean-up you have to do.

### Subscribing for location updates


    LocationRequest request = LocationRequest.create() //standard GMS LocationRequest
                                      .setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY)
                                      .setNumUpdates(5)
                                      .setInterval(100);

    ReactiveLocationProvider locationProvider = new ReactiveLocationProvider(context);
    Subscription subscription = locationUpdatesObservable = locationProvider.getUpdatedLocation(request)
        .filter(...)    // you can filter location updates
        .map(...)       // you can map location to sth different
        .flatMap(...)   // or event flat map
        ...             // and do everything else that is provided by RxJava
        .subscribe(new Action1<Location>() {
            @Override
            public void call(Location location) {
                doSthImportantWithObtainedLocation(location);
            }
        });

When you are done (for example in ```onStop()```) remember to unsubscribe.

    subscription.unsubscribe();

### Geocode location

Do you need address for location?

    Observable<List<Address> geocodeObservable = locationProvider
        .getGeocodeObservable(location.getLatitude(), location.getLongitude(), MAX_ADDRESSES);

    geocodeObservable
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())               // use I/O thread to query for addresses
        .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())  // return result in main android thread to manipulate UI
        .subscribe(...);


### Managing geofences

For geofence management use ```addGeofences``` and ```removeGeofences``` methods.

### Cooler examples

Do you need location with certain accuracy but don't want to wait for it more than 4 sec? No problem.

    LocationRequest req = LocationRequest.create()
                             .setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY)
                             .setExpirationDuration(TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(LOCATION_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS)
                             .setInterval(LOCATION_UPDATE_INTERVAL);

    Observable<Location> goodEnoughQuicklyOrNothingObservable = locationProvider.getUpdatedLocation(req)
                .filter(new Func1<Location, Boolean>() {
                    @Override
                    public Boolean call(Location location) {
                        return location.getAccuracy() < SUFFICIENT_ACCURACY;
                    }
                })
                .timeout(LOCATION_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS, TimeUnit.SECONDS, Observable.from((Location) null), AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
                .first()
                .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread());

    goodEnoughQuicklyOrNothingObservable.subscribe(...);


How to use it?
--------------

For now it is not available in Maven Central so you have to clone it, install it to
you local maven repo by ```gradlew build install``` and use it as dependency in your project
along with Google Play Services and RxJava.

    compile 'pl.charmas.android:android-reactive-location:0.1@aar'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:4.1.32'
    compile 'com.netflix.rxjava:rxjava-android:0.16.1'
